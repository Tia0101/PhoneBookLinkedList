Overview: This is a simple program that creates a phonebook. This program takes user input and checks to see if the entry already exists.If the entry does not exist in the phone book it will make a new entry.
Tools/Skills used: I wrote this program using JAVA. I created a custom package and imported it into the application. 
Reflection: I don't have any plans to work any farther on this project.
